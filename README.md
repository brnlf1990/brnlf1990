I have experience with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. With this expirience, I created a project(website) called Around US. This project started with HTML and CSS. I created the HTML structure using the BEM methodology and with CSS added styles for desktop and made the website responsive. Additionally, I added interactivity with JavaScript and implemented form validation. If the conditions are not met in the inputs, an error message appears below them.


In addition, I have two certifications in AWS, these are Cloud Practitioner and  Solutions Architect Associate. I can create instances in AWS and put websites on this instances.

However, I am studying Software Engineer at the Universidade Cruziero do Sul in Brazil(Online university) and Web Developing at the Tripleten(Online Bootcamp).

Also, I can speak Portuguese, Japanese and English.
